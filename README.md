# Covid_Data_Analysis

# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Prediction Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers **end-to-end COVID-19 data analytics** by combining **big data processing**, **machine learning prediction**, and **interactive dashboard visualization**.

The goal is to:
- Process and clean large-scale COVID-19 datasets.
- Generate key statistical insights.
- Predict COVID-19 deaths based on multiple features.
- Present findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## 🚀 Features
- **Big Data Processing (PySpark)**
  - Cleans and filters massive datasets for reliable analysis.
  - Computes global statistics, mortality, and recovery rates.
- **Machine Learning Prediction (Scikit-learn)**
  - Trains a Linear Regression model to predict deaths from confirmed/recovered cases.
  - Evaluates performance with R², RMSE, and MAE metrics.
- **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)**
  - Displays global trends, top affected countries, and key rates.
  - Interactive filters for exploring regions and time periods.
